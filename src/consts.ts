			'Weekly staff scheduling is a constraint problem. This app lets a manager describe rules in plain language — the AI parses intent, a Python OR-Tools solver enforces feasibility, and a React frontend handles the rest. Gemini or NVIDIA inference, PostgreSQL persistence, and an infeasibility diagnostic when the constraints can\'t be satisfied.',
